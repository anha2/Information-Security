### a) Install TOR browser and access TOR network (.onion addresses). 

I intalled the TOR browser in class so the installation part is coming from my memory.

I went to the https://www.torproject.org/, downloaded the Linux version.

Then in command line I went to the Downloads folder and unzipped the downloaded tar.xz.

Then inside of the folder I went to folder ~/Downloads/tor-browser/Browser.

The right command to start the TOR browser was 

    ./start-tor-browser

### b) Browse TOR network, find, take screenshots and comment

    a site for a well known organization that has a physical street address in the real world

### c) Voluntary or alternative task: No onion. You can do this task in place of a and b. Install a darknet browser other than TOR, such as I2P or Freenet. Search, screenshot and describe examples of contents there.

### d) Voluntary: Crypto hunter. Find Bitcoin address from a darknet site. Use the public ledger to find out if money has been transferred to that address.
