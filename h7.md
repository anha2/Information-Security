#### Shavers & Bair 2016: Hiding Behind the Keyboard: The Tor Browser 

##### "Introduction"

- The Onion Router = Tor
- The browser hide the user’s originating IP address when surfing websites or sending e-mail

##### "History and Intended Use of The Onion Router"

- Allow unfettered and anonymous communication over the Internet

##### "How The Onion Router Works"

- Tor directs the route of a user’s Internet traffic through random relays on the Internet like onion where a layer of encryption is peeled off as it goes through the Tor nodes to its final destination
- The Tor network of relays is run by volunteers and there are over 750,000 users of Tor using over 6000 relays worldwide
- The Tor browser can run from almost anywhere: from external devices, such as a flash drive or external hard drive

##### "Tracking Criminals Using TOR"

- The biggest weakness of the Tor browser is the user: location sharing, plugins
- Any e-mails or Internet connections through a non-Tor browser will show the true IP address of the suspect

### a) Install TOR browser and access TOR network (.onion addresses). 

I intalled the TOR browser in class so the installation part is coming from my memory.

I went to the https://www.torproject.org/, downloaded the Linux version.

Then in command line I went to the Downloads folder and unzipped the downloaded tar.xz.

Then inside of the folder I went to folder ~/Downloads/tor-browser/Browser.

![dn2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5c9189af-0df7-4e0d-8715-c4a6eaafab25)

The right command to start the TOR browser was 

    ./start-tor-browser

### b) Browse TOR network, find, take screenshots and comment

As a search engine for onion sites I used ahmia:

I searhed for marketplace:

I searhed for forum:

![8](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/933bfafd-f9d5-41c9-9d0e-53f85f58fdd8)

![9](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/445e2b98-2458-41e8-8940-c53f97a7afdf)

The site for a well known organization that has a physical street address in the real world was trickier to find since many of the search results did not work or were just market places.
