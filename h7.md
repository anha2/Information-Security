#### Shavers & Bair 2016: Hiding Behind the Keyboard: The Tor Browser €; subchapters: "Introduction", "History and Intended Use of The Onion Router", "How The Onion Router Works", "Tracking Criminals Using TOR".

### a) Install TOR browser and access TOR network (.onion addresses). (Explain in detail how you installed it, and how you got access to TOR. If you got TOR installed in the class, you can write this part from memory. Make not of it if you're writing it from memory and not as you work).

### b) Browse TOR network, find, take screenshots and comment

    search engine for onion sites
    marketplace
    forum
    a site for a well known organization that has a physical street address in the real world

### c) Voluntary or alternative task: No onion. You can do this task in place of a and b. Install a darknet browser other than TOR, such as I2P or Freenet. Search, screenshot and describe examples of contents there.

### d) Voluntary: Crypto hunter. Find Bitcoin address from a darknet site. Use the public ledger to find out if money has been transferred to that address.
