## h6 September2024!

### x) Read or watch and summarize 
        
#### € Schneier 2015: Applied Cryptography: 2.3 One-Way Functions and 2.4 One-Way Hash Functions.


### a) Install Hashcat 
https://terokarvinen.com/2022/cracking-passwords-with-hashcat/

I used Kali for this exercise.

#### Installation
First, I updated the system and then installed hashid, hashcat and wget:

    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get -y install hashid hashcat wget

![1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f1532607-0abd-4e90-a36e-98f52d644a19)

![2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8968b8ee-48b2-4739-8f4c-3c8337924750)

I created new directory and moved inside it:
    mkdir hashed
    cd hashed

![3](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/69f32a68-507c-4751-865d-31b68c349d7d)

Then I used the wget to download compressed archive that has "rockyou.txt". This file contains list of passwords. Then I extracted the content with **tar xf** where: 
-	**x**: Extracts files from the archive
-	**f**: Specifies the file to work on. In this case this will extract the **rockyou.txt** file from the compressed **.tar.gz archive**.
The I remove the compressed archive, and I have the rockyou.txt in my directory.

The complete commands were:

    wget https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/raw/master/Passwords/Leaked-Databases/rockyou.txt.tar.gz
    tar xf rockyou.txt.tar.gz
    rm rockyou.txt.tar.gz

![4](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0628e30b-af45-4d9a-84f2-00abc862766c)

I checked the word count in the document:

    wc -l rockyou.txt 

-	**wc**: word count
-	**-l**:  count only the number of lines
-	**rockyou.txt**: The file for which the line count is being calculated

![5](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/09bc3e7d-01b4-403a-9baa-ee5ddcd5f45a)

So there is more than 14 million password.

#### Identifying Hash Type

    hashid -m 6b1628b016dff46e6fa35684be6acc96

I installed the hashid tool in the beginning.
- **-m** include hash modes used by the Hashcat
- **6b1628b016dff46e6fa35684be6acc96**: This is the hash I want to analyse and identify

![6](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8c03f9b2-9b94-4f36-9c78-64a11acec653)

Hashid analyzed the hash 6b1628b016dff46e6fa35684be6acc96, checked it against known hash patterns, and suggest the possible type(s) of the hash.

#### Cracking the Hash

    hashcat -m 0 '6b1628b016dff46e6fa35684be6acc96' rockyou.txt -o solved

- **hashcat**: the hash cracking program I just installed
- **-m 0** type of the hash, the number I obtained from 'hashid' or 'hashcat --example-hashes'. Now it refers to MD5.
- **'6b1628b016dff46e6fa35684be6acc96'**: the hash I want to crack in single quotes around it
-**o solved**: save the solution as plain text to a new file "solved" in working directory

![7](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/790e3b80-1234-426b-8b29-ac1add570de6)

![8](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2f1a0d62-19a6-4e45-b283-28cbe730e401)

The status was cracked with Hash.Mode 0 (MD5)

I checked the file solved where the solution should be:

    cat solved

![9](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/60b1da9f-ac63-42f1-a618-00ce5f13ec2b)

And we see the password was summer.

### b) Crack this hash: d595b2086532422bbe654bc07ea030df

First I analysed it with hashid:

    hashid -m d595b2086532422bbe654bc07ea030df

![10](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d34d4327-e0bb-4a8d-8e5f-3c9977c8be10)

Then I used the same type of commans as in the example:

    hashcat -m 0 'd595b2086532422bbe654bc07ea030df' rockyou.txt -o solved

![11](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c41f3d0f-9bb0-4a22-b57c-fdcf99aaad06)

![12](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6abbead8-6e59-4f1d-bb6c-0377c298771d)

Again the status was cracked with Hash.Mode 0 (MD5).

I checked the solved file:

![13](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b421825a-cdf6-4a94-96ed-b5b4aaa99b4f)

The answer is: **disobey**.

#### More own testing

I also tried it with two more hashed passwords I created that were in the list: kitkat and roberto.
I used this web page to create the MD5 hashes: https://www.md5hashgenerator.com/

As a result, I got: 
- kitkat: f0bf97d2f85c040963f47c03888434c4
- roberto: c1bfc188dba59d2681648aa0e6ca8c8e

With the kitkat I did the same steps as in the exercise:

![30](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/50a044a9-e1d8-4949-8d1f-a4bce51bdaa8)

![18](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/53174708-68fa-40e9-a6c0-dffe6db63215)

![19](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b8cc4baa-a293-4181-a8e2-ca18bbdc2021)

With roberto I changed the type of hash to 900 (MD4) to see what happens:

![14](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/409c5350-8373-406a-b4cf-64e05d2e9da4)

![15](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/09792161-0b2c-4232-b027-7ca4b44044dd)

Now the status was exhausted. I believe this means that all passwords were tested but nothing matched. Meaning the attempt failed.

I changed the type to 0 (MD5) in the command.

![16](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5d58e448-97c2-471e-a3ad-606840ce2c0e)

![17](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/48468dff-1f9a-4004-8274-33bed18f5555)

This time it was again succesfully cracked and added in the file.

Out of curiosity I made one hash with MD4 in https://md5calc.com/hash/md4:
- 12345: 23580e2a459f7ea40f9efa148b63cafb

![20](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7c869013-0039-48eb-8305-ad61d759f11b)

![21](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/116e7b44-6f75-41f2-9732-988274d93b99)

This time the MD4 with 900 worked.

### m) Voluntary: Compile John the Ripper, Jumbo version. 
https://terokarvinen.com/2023/crack-file-password-with-john/

#### Install

    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get -y install micro bash-completion git build-essential libssl-dev zlib1g zlib1g-dev zlib-gst libbz2-1.0 libbz2-dev atool zip wget

![1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e9e61701-a6e5-429f-85dd-39cccaa5acda)

#### Download & Compile John the Ripper, Jumbo version

    git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/openwall/john.git

    cd john/src/	
    ./configure

![3](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9a0dfe10-d509-4693-a996-d6ee627a1cc9)

I encountered the following problem:

![4](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/295d6dcf-73b6-407b-b94e-086fb0778c2d)

I found out that I need to install libssl-dev (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30330835/openssl-headers-missing-when-building-openssh):

    apt-get install libssl-dev

![5](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ad7e0da5-297d-4309-b238-2bf2fef3ba50)

This time ./configure worked with the output:

![6](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6aa699b9-cd24-4dc5-a57f-29cb260aa5fe)

Then the actual compilation

    make -s clean && make -sj4

![7](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b1e7b32e-f3bc-4cd3-81f8-d54b88410a31)

![8](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/15229cd0-96e3-498a-b789-857ee9e190c7)

Once John is compiled, we can find the new executables and scripts in run/.

    cd ../run/
    ls -1

![9](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a6df69f0-6809-4c9a-b34a-1ab68278fdda)

    $HOME/john/run/john 

![10](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4795f2cb-0f76-494b-bafa-3be567fdb7bd)

It is downloaded, compiled and running.

### n) Voluntary: Crack a zip file password

First I got a sample ZIP from Tero:

    wget https://TeroKarvinen.com/2023/crack-file-password-with-john/tero.zip

![11](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9c8b99a6-e0f5-4594-9ac6-5de335c66ea3)

I tried to open it but it required a password:

![12](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/71cff064-2340-4838-9861-e22a48ec2160)

First, I extracted the hash into a new file called tero.zip.hash.

    $HOME/john/run/zip2john tero.zip >tero.zip.hash

![13](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9c03db60-0722-45b3-99cc-e7e079347ebf)

Then was time for John perform a dictionary attack against the hash.

    $HOME/john/run/john tero.zip.hash 
   
![14](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/992a15d4-2224-46bc-b45e-5362d2aa195a)

In the print I can see that the password is **butterfly**.

I now used to password and checked the content:

    unzip tero.zip 
    cat secretFiles/SECRET.md 
    
![15](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/46818ccb-97f1-4013-b68d-c42b131fed4f)

### o) Voluntary: create a password protected file other than ZIP. Crack the password. How many formats can you handle?

I created two password protected pdfs. 

The first one was called secret-protected.pdf and it has a weak password. Other one is SemiSecret-suojattu.pdf and it has 6 random character password. 

The commands I used to crack the passwords:

    $HOME/john/run/pdf2john.pl secret-protected.pdf >secret-protected.pdf.hash
    $HOME/john/run/john secret-protected.pdf.hash

![21](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d71f7b84-881b-452b-9de2-b5dd17e2d725)

In just seconds the password was cracked.

In my next example I just changed the filenames in the previous commands. This time it took way longer.
### p) Voluntary: Watch and summarize: Forbes 2019: Jackpotting ATM's (Automated Teller Machines) - Its easier than you might think. Presented in Disobey 2019.

I watched this already as h3 task. 

Here are the points I picked up:
- **Note: The video is 5 years old so things might have changed**
- Only handful main players left
- The software is heavily standardised and most ATMs are Windows based
- If ATM drops from network shortly the reason is not inspected
- 30% don't authenticate the back-end properly
- I takes a lot of time to empty an ATM (only certain number of notes are given out and need to be calculated)
