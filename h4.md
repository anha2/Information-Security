#### OWASP: OWASP 10 2021

##### A01:2021 – Broken Access Control
https://owasp.org/Top10/A01_2021-Broken_Access_Control/

- Access control: users cannot act outside of their intended permissions
- For example:
    - Access should only be granted for particular capabilities, roles, or users, but is available to anyone
    - Missing access controls for POST, PUT and DELETE in API
- Preventing:
    - Except for public resources, deny by default
    - Rate limit API and controller access to minimize the harm from automated attack tooling

##### A05:2021-Security Misconfiguration
https://owasp.org/Top10/A05_2021-Security_Misconfiguration/

- For example:
    - Unnecessary features are enabled or installed (e.g., unnecessary ports, services, pages, accounts, or privileges)
    - Default accounts and their passwords are still enabled and unchanged.
- Preventing:
    - Development, QA, and production environments should all be configured identically, with different credentials used in each environment
   
##### A06:2021-Vulnerable and Outdated Components
https://owasp.org/Top10/A06_2021-Vulnerable_and_Outdated_Components/

- For example:
    - The software is vulnerable, unsupported, or out of date
    - Software developers do not test the compatibility of updated, upgraded, or patched libraries
- Preventing:
    - Continuously inventory the versions of both client-side and server-side components
        
##### A03:2021-Injection
https://owasp.org/Top10/A03_2021-Injection/

- For example:
    - SQL, NoSQL, OS command, Object Relational Mapping (ORM), LDAP, and Expression Language (EL) or Object Graph Navigation Library (OGNL) injection
- Prevent:
    - Use a safe API, which avoids using the interpreter
    - Use positive server-side input validation

### a) Goat. 

I used Kali for the excercise.

I first installed the latest version v2023.8 and the port command was not working. The port 8080 always popped up.

With the version 2023.4 the port command below worked just fine:

     java -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8 -Dwebgoat.port=8888 -Dwebwolf.port=9090 -jar webgoat-2023.4.jar

### b) F12. 

"***WARNING 1:*** While running this program your machine will be extremely vulnerable to attack. You should disconnect from the Internet while using this program. WebGoat’s default configuration binds to localhost to minimize the exposure." https://owasp.org/www-project-webgoat/

I registered myself and logged in. 

I selected the general and Developer tools.

I used Google Chrome because it was introduced in the task.

First task was to use the console in the dev tools and call the javascript function:

    webgoat.customjs.phoneHome()

I entered to function and got back the number. I inserted it in the field and got feedback "Correct!".

![3](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/25a3596f-0a26-4a36-b405-4c41a0814b5d)

The second task was to click the first button and this generated an HTTP request. The request  contained a field: networkNum: that I inserted in the field "What is the number you found:". I found the number from Network tab. There I saw that network was created when I pressed the Go button. I clicked it open. Under Payload tab was the needed numer.

### c) Not outdated. 

I updated all operating system and all applications with the following commands:

    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get dist-upgrade

![5](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6ef62f77-829b-46fe-8a0a-1e1a9e2d70b6)

Update was very fast but upgrade took a lot of time. I think this is because Kali has so many preinstalled programs already.

### d) Sequel. Solve SQLZoo:

### e) Johnny tables

Task was to solve Portswigger Labs: Lab: SQL injection vulnerability in WHERE clause allowing retrieval of hidden data. At the start was just wep page and different items.

![9](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1c6ba1f6-57dc-451f-a2a0-0c044fe7b08b)

I clicked the "Gifts" and checked the address bar

![10](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5b292412-49b4-4ced-a666-d6905099e24b)

I inserted the following line after the "category=":

    '+OR+1=1--

The explanations were from the Youtube videos SQL Injection to Retrieve Hidden Data! and SQL Injection - Lab #1 SQL injection vulnerability in WHERE clause allowing retrieval of hidden data.

**'**:
This closes an existing string in an SQL query. By closing the string with ', the attacker is able to insert arbitrary SQL code after the gategory field.

**OR 1=1**:
When inserted into an SQL query, it makes the condition true, regardless of any actual input value. For example, if an attacker injects OR 1=1, the SQL query could become:

**--**:
This is an SQL comment indicator. Everything that follows the -- is ignored by the SQL engine. By placing this after the injected statement, the attacker can "comment out" the rest of the original query, preventing errors and making the injection more effective.
