### a) Goat. 

I first installed the latest version v2023.8 and the port command was not working. The port 8080 always popped up.

With the version 2023.4 the port command below worked just fine:

     java -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8 -Dwebgoat.port=8888 -Dwebwolf.port=9090 -jar webgoat-2023.4.jar

### b) F12. 

***WARNING 1:*** While running this program your machine will be extremely vulnerable to attack. You should disconnect from the Internet while using this program. WebGoat’s default configuration binds to localhost to minimize the exposure. https://owasp.org/www-project-webgoat/

I registered myself and logged in. 

I selected the general and Developer tools.

I used Google Chrome because it was introduced in the task.

First task was to use the console in the dev tools and call the javascript function:

    webgoat.customjs.phoneHome()

I entered to function and got back the number. I inserted it in the field and got feedback "Correct!".

The second task was to click the first button and this generated an HTTP request. The request  contained a field: networkNum: that I inserted in the field "What is the number you found:". I found the number from Network tab. There I saw that network was created when I pressed the Go button. I clicked it open. Under Payload tab was the needed numer.
