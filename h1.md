### a. Security hygiene. What basic security practices should everyone follow? Are there some security hygiene practicies that every company or average Joe should follow? (This subtask does not require tests with a computer. A bullet list is enough)
    b) Make-belief boogie-man - a threat model for imaginary company.
        This subtask does not require tests with a computer.
        Create an imaginary company and create threat model.
        Business requirements come from business, technical specialist help with tech. Inlude this in your narrative.
        Your analysis should cover all parts of the four question model (four key questions in Threat modeling manifesto)
            (1) What are we working on?
                Our assets
                    Priorization, key assets
                    E.g. customer health data is a crown jevel, personel gaming server is probably not
                Security supports business
                Draw a diagram of the company systems
                Customer is the king
                    What do we have to do the serve the customer (to keep getting paid)
                    How does customer see our systems? Touchpoints?
                Write a description.
            (2) What can go wrong?
                Apply one or more named models: Attack trees, STRIDE, CIA, ATT&CK...
                    Give some examples of identified risks - you don't need to find all risks or likely vulnerabilites, as there would be too many for this homework.
                Priorize biggest risks
                    High expected value (or other very high risk)
                    Expected value = probability * monetary value
                    Expected value is a tool for discussion, it's not exact science as we have to guestimate the input numbers
                Are you targetted by specific threat actors? Are there actors that target your geographical or political area or industry?
                    Known TTPs? (tactics, techniques, procedures)
                    COI - Capability, Opportunity, Intent
                Business continuity
                    We have to keep serving the customer to receive money.
                    Stakeholders (customer, employees...) trust us. Trust is hard to get and easy to lose.
            (3) What are we going to do about it?
                Can you: reduce attack surface, limit entry points...
                META: Mitigage, Eliminate, Transfer, Accept.
            (4) Did we do a good enough job?
                Security audits, pentests, assesments, continous threat modeling and evaluation
                Process, not a one time job. It never ends.
