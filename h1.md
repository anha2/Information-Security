#### Threat modeling: Braiterman et al 2020: Threat modeling manifesto https://www.threatmodelingmanifesto.org/

- Threat modeling helps you recognizing what can go wrong in a system and help you successfully develop more secure applications, systems, and organizations.

- Everyone should do it, and it is better to create multiple threat modelling representations to make different problems visible

- The output of the threat model makes threats visible and gives decision making input in how to improve the application or system. 

- Four key questions
  
    1. What are we working on?
    2. What can go wrong?
    3. What are we going to do about it?
    4. Did we do a good enough job?
 
- The Threat Modeling Manifesto has values and principles

#### Shostack 2022: Welcome to the Worlds Shortest Threat Modeling Course https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCVhBqLDKoOOZqKt74QI4pbDUnXSQo0nf

- We threat model to anticipate problens when it's inexpensive to deal with them. This means before any code's been written, any chips have been produced or any concrete's been poured

#### OWASP CheatSheets Series Team 2021: Threat Modeling Cheat Sheet https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Threat_Modeling_Cheat_Sheet.html

- The four questions above are the Foundation for the four major phases below

1. System Modeling

    - Critical step, we need to understand a system
    - Tool: data flow diagrams (DFDs) 

2. Threat Identification

    - identifyi and rank threats 
    -  Tool: STRIDE

3. Response and Mitigations

    - Mitigate, eliminate, transfer or accept

4. Review and Validation

    - The threat model must be reviewed by all stakeholders

Challenges: 

- Many developers lack sufficient knowledge and experience in the field of security -> proper IT security training 

-  The threat modeling process can be complex and time-consuming -> sufficient tools and resources 

- Communication and collaboration between different departments within the organization -> communicate effectively and promote a culture of security

### a. Security hygiene

Tealtech (https://tealtech.com/blog/computer-practices/) has listed "Top 10 Computing Practices All Users Should Follow".

- Install Available Updates
- Backup Important Data
- Keep Your Computer Clean and Organized (Don't install everything)
- Avoid Public Wi-Fi Networks
- Use Strong, Unique Passwords
- Keep Antivirus Software Enabled and Updated
- Practice Safe Browsing 
-  Don't Forget About Physical Security (e.g., stealing a laptop)


### b) Make-belief boogie-man - a threat model for imaginary company.

I chose a bookstore that operates online. 

#### (1) What are we working on?

**Key assets:**

- Customer Data: Crown jewel, if this is lost it could lead to significant financial loss and reputational damage

- Inventory Database: Without inventory database we have no business

**Other assets:**

- Employee Data: personal and financial details about employees

- Financial Records: Transaction records, revenue data, and payroll information

- Digital Content: E-books and digital reading materials available to customers

**Security Supports Business**

- Security is critical to maintaining customer trust and protecting sensitive information

**Customer is King**

- Online Experience: Customers interact with the website or mobile app for browsing, purchasing, and accessing digital content

- Website and Mobile App: Entry points for online shopping and digital content access

#### (2) What can go wrong?

Risk Model Applied: STRIDE 

- Spoofing (S): An attacker could impersonate a customer or employee to gain access to sensitive data

    - Risk: Unauthorized access to customer data
    - Impact: High, leading to data theft and potential financial fraud

- Tampering (T): Altering inventory or financial data within the systems

    - Risk: Manipulation of inventory records or financial transactions
    - Impact: Medium to high, could disrupt operations and result in financial loss

- Information Disclosure (I): Exposing customer data or internal records due to poor access controls

    - Risk: Data breach exposing sensitive customer information
    - Impact: High, severe damage to reputation and potential legal repercussions

- Denial of Service (D): Attack on the website or mobile app to make it unavailable to customers

    - Risk: Website downtime during peak shopping periods
    - Impact: High, resulting in loss of sales and customer trust

- Elevation of Privilege (E): Exploiting vulnerabilities to gain higher access rights

    - Risk: Unauthorized user gaining admin-level access to systems
    - Impact: High, could lead to extensive data breaches and system manipulation

**Prioritized Risks:**

- Customer Data Breach: Probability is moderate to high; monetary value is extremely high due to legal penalties, loss of customer trust, and potential compensation costs

- Denial of Service (DoS) Attack: Probability is moderate; monetary value is high due to potential revenue loss during critical periods (e.g., holiday season)

**Threat Actors:**

- Cybercriminals: Motivated by financial gain, targeting customer data and payment information
- Competitors: Industrial espionage to gain insights into BookVerse's operations and customer base
- Hacktivists: Targeting the business for ideological reasons, possibly through DoS attacks

**Known TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, Procedures):**

- Phishing: Common method for initial access by tricking employees into revealing credentials
- SQL Injection: To exploit vulnerabilities in the website's database management system
- Ransomware: Encrypting critical business data to demand a ransom

**Business Continuity:**

Maintaining operational integrity is essential. Even a short disruption could lead to significant revenue loss and lower customer trust. Regular backups, disaster recovery planning, and failover systems are vital to ensure continuous service.

#### (3) What are we going to do about it?

- Limit entry points: Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all user accounts, especially those with administrative access
- Regular Security Audits: Conduct frequent vulnerability assessments and penetration testing to identify and fix potential weaknesses
- Data Encryption: Encrypt sensitive customer and financial data 
- Network Segmentation: Isolate critical systems (e.g., customer and inventory databases) from less secure environments

**META Approach:**

- Mitigate: Implement strong access controls and monitoring systems to detect and prevent unauthorized access
- Eliminate: Remove outdated or unnecessary software that could introduce vulnerabilities
- Transfer: Obtain cyber insurance to cover potential losses from data breaches or cyber-attacks
- Accept: Minor risks with low probability and low impact may be accepted after careful evaluation

#### (4) Did we do a good enough job?

**Continuous Evaluation:**

- Security Audits: Regularly schedule internal and external audits to ensure compliance with security policies and identify new threats

- Penetration Testing: Engage third-party security experts to simulate attacks and test the resilience of systems

- Continuous Monitoring: Implement real-time monitoring of systems for suspicious activities, with automated alerts for potential security incidents

- Regular Training: Conduct ongoing cybersecurity training for employees to keep them aware of current threats and best practices
