### a) Pretty Good indeed. 

Encrypt and decrypt a message with 'gnupg', using PGP public key cryptography. (Note that here you learn each step; for end users, you can often automate and make it look simple)

### b) Password manager, open and cloudless. 

I chose KeePassXC. According their website: "We do the heavy lifting in a no-nonsense, ad-free, tracker-free, and cloud-free manner. Free and open source."
https://keepassxc.org/

I followed their getting started tutorial in install and use KeePassXC: https://keepassxc.org/docs/KeePassXC_GettingStarted#_downloading_keepassxc

I clicked the download button and chose Windows 10/11. After download it was time to install it with the Wizard.

First I accepted the terms in the License Agreement.

![KP2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6189935f-b439-4182-8825-5aee38b7eeb7)

Then I chose the destination folder and that I wanted the progran to autostart.

![KP3](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d74cd5be-a05c-48f9-846f-6ac19b65e14c)

Then it was time to make the installation.

![KP4](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/84a70582-7c89-4f09-9979-cf4f76844a67)

And after installation I chose to launch KeePassXC.

Note: The program pictures show the Finnish version.
I also allowed screen shots 

![KP6](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/79295309-4c18-4ccd-a185-8972bf5eb949)

![KP11](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8c80536e-6bf1-4cad-a7f4-ce507a12f961)

Then it was time to create my first database (+ Luo tietokanta)

I entered the database name and a short description that is optional:

![KP7](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3bf54da0-1bc0-4a8c-9da4-fb60be1c00f9)

Next was encryption settings. It was recommended to keep it as the were. The Decryption Time slider at higher values means that the database will have higher level of protection but the time taken by the database to open will increase.

![KP8](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7b412b0d-7ddb-4d12-b9e6-d23bb4bef008)

![KP9](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3d67d079-c588-4e93-b38e-5a3f37b2cb0e)

In the Database Credentials screen I entered my database password. It was recommended to use a long, randomized password.

**Note from KeePassXC: Keep this password for your database safe. Either memorize it or note it down somewhere. Losing the database password might result in permanent locking of your database and you will not be able to retrieve information stored in the database. **

![KP10](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/429d87c5-0003-4b9f-ad3f-04b18758b826)

Then I was asked to choose a location to save my database file. I stored in a nice place in the depth of my computer.

Then it was time to star using KeePassXC.

Choose a password manager that 1) works without cloud 2) is free, open source sofware. Install it. Demonstrate its use. Explain why a password manager is needed i.e. what kind of attacks or threats it protects against.

### m) Voluntary bonus: Encrypt and decrypt messages using a tool other than 'gnupg'. Explain each step. Why did you choose the tool you used here? Evaluate the tool.
### n) Voluntary bonus: send and receive encrypted message over email.
### o) Voluntary bonus: Find out frequency distribution of letters for a language that you know (other than English). What are the six most common letters? (This subtask y does not require tests with a computer if the question can be answered without them)
### p) Voluntary bonus: Install OpenSSH server, connect to it using 'ssh' client.
### q) Voluntary bonus: Automate SSH connection using public keys.
### r) Voluntary bonus: TLS. Choose a transport layer security (TLS) certificate used for the web. Explain key fields. How do you / browser know it's legit? Who says so?
### s) Voluntary bonus: ETAOIN. Crack this ciphertext:

### t) Voluntary bonus, easy: try rot13, the military grade top-secret encryption of the top-2 empire of year zero. Could double rot13 provide extra security? Why?
    
### u) Voluntary difficult multiweek bonus, requries coding skills: Cryptopals (recommended, if you have what it takes).
