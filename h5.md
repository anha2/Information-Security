#### Karvinen 2023: PGP - Send Encrypted and Signed Message - gpg
https://terokarvinen.com/2023/pgp-encrypt-sign-verify/



### a) Pretty Good indeed. 

Encrypt and decrypt a message with 'gnupg', using PGP public key cryptography. (Note that here you learn each step; for end users, you can often automate and make it look simple)

### b) Password manager, open and cloudless. 

Choose a password manager that 1) works without cloud 2) is free, open source sofware. Install it. Demonstrate its use. Explain why a password manager is needed i.e. what kind of attacks or threats it protects against.

### m) Voluntary bonus: Encrypt and decrypt messages using a tool other than 'gnupg'. Explain each step. Why did you choose the tool you used here? Evaluate the tool.
### n) Voluntary bonus: send and receive encrypted message over email.
### o) Voluntary bonus: Find out frequency distribution of letters for a language that you know (other than English). What are the six most common letters? (This subtask y does not require tests with a computer if the question can be answered without them)
### p) Voluntary bonus: Install OpenSSH server, connect to it using 'ssh' client.
### q) Voluntary bonus: Automate SSH connection using public keys.
### r) Voluntary bonus: TLS. Choose a transport layer security (TLS) certificate used for the web. Explain key fields. How do you / browser know it's legit? Who says so?
### s) Voluntary bonus: ETAOIN. Crack this ciphertext:

### t) Voluntary bonus, easy: try rot13, the military grade top-secret encryption of the top-2 empire of year zero. Could double rot13 provide extra security? Why?
    
### u) Voluntary difficult multiweek bonus, requries coding skills: Cryptopals (recommended, if you have what it takes).
