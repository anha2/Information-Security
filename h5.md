#### € Schneier 2015: Applied Cryptography: Chapter 1: Foundations

- **Authentication**: An intruder should not be able to masquerade as someone else.
- **Integrity**: An intruder should not be able to substitute a false message for a legitimate one.
- **Nonrepudiation**: A sender should not be able to falsely deny later that he sent a message.

- **Symmetric algorithms**: The encryption key can be calculated from the decryption key and vice versa. 
- **Public-key algorithms** or **asymmetric algorithms**: The key used for encryption is different from the key used for decryption

- **Cryptanalysis**: The science of recovering the plaintext of a message without access to the key
  
#### Karvinen 2023: PGP - Send Encrypted and Signed Message - gpg
https://terokarvinen.com/2023/pgp-encrypt-sign-verify/

- **PGP**: Pretty good privacy
- **GPG**: GNU privacy guard
- Way to encrypt and sign
- The keypair consists of public key and secret key
  - Secret key: if someone ever sees it, I would have to go to each service where it's used and disable it
  - Public key: It can be put on a web page and uploaded it to key servers
- The public key is used to encrypt the message and is given to the other person
- The secret key is used to sign the message
- The sender can't decrypt the message after sending. The receiver uses the secret key to decrypt it. (Asymmetric Encryption)

### a) Pretty Good indeed. 

I used Kali for this excercise.

#### Installation

I updated the system and installed gpg (encryption tool), micro (text editor) and psmisc (package contains a set of small utilities like killall)

    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install gpg micro psmisc

![1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7a36b433-cc32-4a27-bdcf-bff7c5f37447)

In our scenario Alice will send an encrypted message to Aha.
Alice needs Aha's public key to encrypt. Aha needs Alice's public key to verify Alice's signature.

#### Generate Aha's Keypair

    gpg --gen-key

![4](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e6ece41e-4608-41fd-b934-c7ff652d93b8)

I needed to give the "Real name" and "Email address".

I did not protect this key with a password as was shown in the example (I left the password fields empty). The warning messages popped up twice.

![2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/960142d6-4f3e-4623-b1b7-8b03a1361475)

![3](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bd439d9e-5822-4f7c-9d4d-6dfcf39042dd)

I checked the result with the following command:

    gpg --fingerprint 

The command shows the details.

![5](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e928f019-8f14-4192-9713-f2013b64c6cb)


#### Export Aha public key

I moved to home directory with cd and export the public key

    cd
    gpg --export --armor --output aha.pub

- **export**: Export Aha public key
- **armor**: Only use ASCII characters
- **output aha.pub**: Save the output into the file "aha.pub"

![6](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/86152689-3ca3-4fad-aa88-619963b49960)

The I checked first four rows of the public key:

    ls
    head -4 aha.pub 

![7](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9eb4935e-d9e1-4c99-8883-eab2c07e5606)

The public key is in ASCII armor and not readable.

#### Alice, Simulated

I created folder in my home directory (Alice) and gave it rights so I can only use it.

    cd
    mkdir alice/
    chmod og-rwx alice/

![8](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/922ffaaf-8ac3-4f6b-ad11-4da93fc6baa2)

To simulate Alice I worked inside this folder, and replaced 'gpg' with 'gpg --homedir .' Every command as Alice will run in Alice's directory 'cd ~/alice', and start with 'gpg --homedir.

    cd alice/
    gpg --homedir . --fingerprint

![9](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/af62c8b6-01d4-48d0-a0fa-ee0b73fdaa4b)

#### Alice's keypair

Like with Aha, I created the keypair for Alice ("gpg --homedir" refer to Alice).

    gpg --homedir . --gen-key
    gpg --homedir . –fingerprint

![10](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7479c1b6-d884-46d6-863d-b1a88df9006d)

![11](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/74423588-2728-4d8e-91c3-1b73f2637c6a)

#### Alice imports and verifies Aha’s key

I copied the exported public key as Alice 

    cd
    cp -v aha.pub alice/
    cd alice/
    gpg --homedir . --import aha.pub

![12](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c8a1f39a-cccf-4d23-9aae-17415a540060)

#### Alice check the fingerprint to verify that this is indeed Aha's key

    gpg --homedir . --fingerprint

Alice can see the email and name en verify it is right.

![13](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6db626e2-d63b-4385-abca-5a2c6b840d40)

#### Alice signs Aha’s key to mark it as trusted.  

    gpg --homedir . --sign-key "3BCD 6509 E434 5F0E 3ABA  37C4 7783 95E3 5305 25BA"

![14](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2da099e1-260f-4a6f-8e36-a90756c650ca)

    gpg --homedir . --fingerprint

The status in fingerprint changed from unknown to full.

![15](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9657f64e-2372-44d7-99e0-45365940b98e)

#### Aha needs Alices Public Key to Know It's Her

    gpg --homedir . --export --armor --output alice.pub

![16](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/76e11356-3c2d-4af5-971d-d71c561dea1e)

    cd 
    cp -v alice/alice.pub .

![17](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bb0e55e6-b0f6-4853-b7d4-4ba62b181dbf)

Aha imports the key

    gpg --import alice.pub
    
![18](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/69d64b2a-440d-4cd4-bdc6-87a5d86d4b07)

    gpg --sign-key "3468 3DC0 5C9D 05A8 4FF1  4EBF 2924 28E1 27BC 6C16”
    gpg --fingerprint

![19](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0827e0f7-9588-44ca-997d-1fa2ac90523d)

![20](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b212cd0c-b50c-4bc6-810e-ae2a906ee6f7)

#### Alice Sends a Secret Message

First I created a new file as Alice, wrote the message in the file and encrypted and signed the message

    cd ~/alice/
    micro message.txt
    gpg --homedir . --encrypt --recipient aha@aha.com.invalid --sign --output encrypted.pgp --armor message.txt
    
- **--encrypt**: Encrypt the message
- **--recipient**: aha@aha.com.invalid (key identified by email address)  
- **--sign**: Sign the message using Alice's secret key.
- **--armor**: Use normal, printable ASCII characters for the message. 
- **--output encrypted.pgp**: Save the encrypted message to this file
- **message.txt**: The plain text file we wish to encrypt

![21](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/799d0c5f-ddae-4944-a89f-be54efe6abd3)

    ls encrypted.pgp
    head -4 encrypted.pgp 

Encrypted message was created and we can see the first four lines but tehy are still encrypted.

![22](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/16090ddf-af14-4596-83a1-c77365348522)

Encrypted message can be sent over hostile, untrusted channel like the Internet so I simulated the transfer by copying the file.

    cp -v alice/encrypted.pgp .

![24](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a3b2e205-5d68-4aa1-9beb-a7d08eb72ff9)

#### Aha decrypt and verify the message

    gpg --decrypt encrypted.pgp 

![23](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6ff0fbfa-d143-4c7b-a9eb-3b2d6fd61834)


### b) Password manager, open and cloudless. 

I chose KeePassXC. According their website: "We do the heavy lifting in a no-nonsense, ad-free, tracker-free, and cloud-free manner. Free and open source."
https://keepassxc.org/

I followed their getting started tutorial in install and use KeePassXC: https://keepassxc.org/docs/KeePassXC_GettingStarted#_downloading_keepassxc

I clicked the download button and chose Windows 10/11. After download it was time to install it with the Wizard.

![KP1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5aaba8f3-9174-4a63-94c4-a2e9c5424922)

First I accepted the terms in the License Agreement.

![KP2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6189935f-b439-4182-8825-5aee38b7eeb7)

Then I chose the destination folder and that I wanted the progran to autostart.

![KP3](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d74cd5be-a05c-48f9-846f-6ac19b65e14c)

Then it was time to make the installation.

![KP4](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/84a70582-7c89-4f09-9979-cf4f76844a67)

And after installation I chose to launch KeePassXC.

![KP5](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/81851392-d29f-4415-abaa-34ff5d5c7a98)

Note: The program pictures show the Finnish version.
I also allowed screen shots 

![KP6](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/79295309-4c18-4ccd-a185-8972bf5eb949)

![KP11](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8c80536e-6bf1-4cad-a7f4-ce507a12f961)

Then it was time to create my first database (+ Luo tietokanta)

I entered the database name and a short description that is optional:

![KP7](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3bf54da0-1bc0-4a8c-9da4-fb60be1c00f9)

Next was encryption settings. It was recommended to keep it as the were. The Decryption Time slider at higher values means that the database will have higher level of protection but the time taken by the database to open will increase.

![KP8](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7b412b0d-7ddb-4d12-b9e6-d23bb4bef008)

![KP9](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3d67d079-c588-4e93-b38e-5a3f37b2cb0e)

In the Database Credentials screen I entered my database password. It was recommended to use a long, randomized password.

**Note from KeePassXC: Keep this password for your database safe. Either memorize it or note it down somewhere. Losing the database password might result in permanent locking of your database and you will not be able to retrieve information stored in the database. **

![KP10](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/429d87c5-0003-4b9f-ad3f-04b18758b826)

Then I was asked to choose a location to save my database file. I stored in a nice place in the depth of my computer.

Then it was time to star using KeePassXC.

![KP12](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b9f84263-3060-49ec-8e4d-3ca7ea30c401)

I clicked the **+** to add a new entry.

![KP14](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c21768d4-6f83-4da4-9566-d3f77d4f6116)

I gave it a title, entered the username and password and inserted the URL. I accepted the cnahges with OK.

![KP15](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/65c90e65-479a-4f7e-bfad-0c11d898ee4a)

Now that is is created I can copy the username, copy the password or copy the URL. The clipboard only holds the infromation for 10 seconds as default. This can be changed from the menu.

Password manager is needed because every place needs a password these days. It is important to have unique passwords because passwords leak periodically. The password and username combo can be used to trying to access other services. Browser-based password managers are vulnerable to malware attacks. Also browser-based password managers only work with that spesific browser. With dedicated password manager it is easier to access the service without browser limitations. Also it is simpler to keep up one database of passwords than update all the browsers in all devices. 

The pre-entered URL will also keep the user safer. If the site is a phishing attempt, the password manager won't fill in the credentials, alerting the user that something is wrong. Password managers also prevent keyloggers from capturing credentials because users don’t need to type the passwords. They are copied directly from the manager to the login field. With a password manager, you only need to remember one master password to access all your credentials, while the manager itself ensures encrypted storage and secure backup across devices.
