### x) Read/watch/listen and summarize 

### a) Bandit oh-five

#### Bandit Level 0

I used Kali to solve the problems.

I opened the terminal and used the following ssh command to log into the game:

     ssh bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220 -l bandit0

- ssh initiated a secure shell connection and allowed remote login to a server
- bandit.labs.overthewire.org was the hostname of the server I wanted to connect to
- -p 2220 specified the port (the default port for SSH is 22)
- -l bandit0 specified the login name

I was asked to enter the password that was "bandit0" and I was in.

#### Bandit Level 0 → Level 1

The next password was stored in a file called readme. I used the following commands:

    ls -la
    cat readme

First command listed all the folders and files. With the cat command I checked what was inside the readme and found the next password. I exited the current ssh session with *exit*.

#### Bandit Level 1 → Level 2

    ssh bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220 -l bandit1

I opened new ssh with login name "bandit1" and inserted the password found.

*Note:* To copy-paste I needed to use short keys "ctrl+shift+c" and "ctrl+shift+v".

The password for the next level was stored in a file called - located in the home directory. 

The "-" is special character in Unix and typically it is used with argument(s). The command-line would not understand just "cat -" because it is waiting for argument with -. Giving the full path will solve this issue. This is why I used the following commands to find the password:

    ls -la
    cat ~/-

![8](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/82605d89-246d-4617-8507-611b7c4259a6)

Now the password was visible for me to exit this ssh session and move on.
 
#### Bandit Level 2 → Level 3

    ssh bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220 -l bandit2

I opened new ssh with login name "bandit2" and inserted the password found.

The password for the next level was stored in a file called spaces in this filename located in the home directory.

Now I saw that the file has spaces between the words. I Unix space the command-line shell interprets spaces as separators between different arguments. "cat spaces in this filename" is trying to run cat with four arguments and fail since these don't exist. "\" can be used to fix this problem. Also wrapping the entire filename in quotes will fix this problem.

    ls -la
    cat spaces\ in\ this\ filename 
    cat "spaces in this filename"

Now the password was visible for me to exit this ssh session and move on.

#### Bandit Level 3 → Level 4

    ssh bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220 -l bandit3

I opened new ssh with login name "bandit3" and inserted the password found.

![13](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2319d504-36e6-4552-b623-529f35925396)

The password for the next level was stored in a hidden file in the inhere directory.

    ls -la
    cd inhere	
    cat ...Hiding-From-You 

I checked that the inhere directory was to be found and moved to the directory. I checked what was inside the directory and checked the file and found the next password.

![15](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b3f20a1e-7967-44cd-87dc-ea0f227a03d3)

If I just used "ls" inside inhere I would not have found the file. With "ls -la" I was able to see the hidden files. 

- ls list files and directories
- -l display detailed information about files and directories (permissions, file size, filename etc.)
- -a  includes hidden files in the output


### b) Can't fish.

I was using Kali and in the right up corner was the tap to disconnect.

![18](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/aaa42f01-02ec-4586-946d-43d9507dca35)

I run the following ping commands to verify that the network was disabled:

    ping 1.1.1.1
    ping 8.8.8.8

![19](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d1ec4dbc-246c-4ebc-a8cd-e454d02cd136)

If the Network was not disabled, I would have had the following:

### c) Local only

I had nmap already installed.

![22](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/42f13e13-7940-418f-bd2b-463d3b2c7962)

I used the given command:

    sudo nmap -A localhost

- sudo means that I run it with superuser or root privileges
- nmap discover hosts, services, open ports, and vulnerabilities in a network
- -A enables aggressive scan (OS detection, Version detection, Script scanning, etc.) 
- localhost refers to my machine

![21](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4fcead9b-1233-49dd-b0d1-b21f509ce02f)

As a result, I can see that Host is up with 57 microseconds latency. 
"All 1000 scanned ports on localhost (127.0.0.1) are in ignored states.
" Means that the ports are in a state that is not considered interesting. This often means they are either filtered or closed.


### d) Daemon
